Supporting UNEP and the Government of Georgia to submit a full-compliant Medium-Sized project (<$1M) request to GEF in the Land Degradation focal area. 

Georgia is a lower-middle income country in the Caucasus region. The project's objective is to establish a strong framework for Sustainable Land Management at national policy level and demonstrate economically viable land management practices by rural communities at demonstration sites.
