Jessica manages the Cross-Sector Biodiversity Initiative (CSBI), a partnership between IPIECA (the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues), the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the Equator Principles Association. CSBI exists to develop and share good practices on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the extractive industries.

Working closely with leading companies such as Shell, BP, JP Morgan Chase, ExxonMobil, Citi and Anglo American, Jessica's role entails secretariat management, technical support and day-to-day running of the CSBI and its member-led working groups.
