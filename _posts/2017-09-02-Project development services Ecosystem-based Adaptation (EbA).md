---

We are providing project development services to the [International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)](www.iied.org)) and [IUCN - the world conservation union](www.iucn.org). The team isÂ to identifying and bringing together partners, and collaborating to develop initial concepts and proposal elements, in the SADC region for a proposal on Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) and sustainable financing.
