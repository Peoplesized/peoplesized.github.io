Coordinated the Project Document and CEO endorsement request development for a $7m Ecosystem-based Adaptation project, the first such project to access funds from GEF's Least Developed Countries Fund. 

On behalf of UNDP and the Government of Burkina Faso, Jessica worked in French and English with a drafting team comprised of an international ecosystem specialist and 5 national technical consultants, providing technical guidance to field studies, drafting sections, and addressing feedback. The result was a coherent and compliant document, approved with remarkably positive feedback, in a new area for the Fund.
