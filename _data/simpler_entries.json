Without good information on who owns the land, it's very risky for investors and others to engage due to the likelihood of legal challenges, etc.\n\nMaBoundary is a first rough prototype of a solution to this problem. It uses smartphone GPS to track where the user walks, so they can trace the outline of their plot and begin to make a formal claim. It's designed to run in the web browser of the simplest smartphones.\n\nThere's also a rough admin section, where you can review the collected boundaries, view them on a map, and also see the areas of conflicting claims.\n\nTo try the application out without needing to walk around, use [this version](http://maboundary.herokuapp.com/?token=demo&usemap=true). It just adds a special `usemap=true` code in the address - this makes it easier to test and demo. Instead of walking, you move the map with your finger and pressing 'mark' will use the centre-point of the map as the marker.\n\nWorked with @th3james and @deciob and others at Ecohack 2014"
